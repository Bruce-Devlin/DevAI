# DevAI
A C#, ASP.NET API used to interact with a .NET AI.

This AI is based on [.NET Machine Learning](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai) and is currently trained to identify the difference between Cats and Dogs along with spotting the sentiment of a comment or message (positive/negative).

You can use the [demo site](http://s1.publiczeus.com:5165/) to play around with this or feel free to run it for yourself!
